### Project Description:
TogaSushi is a website and restaurant that offers users the ability to view its menu, location, and reviews. In addition to being a resource for customers, the website also provides a backend system that allows the restaurant staff to log dine-in orders, manage customer orders by table, track food selection, charges, payment method (even if only card payment is accepted), and more. This project was a collaborative effort between myself and a classmate.

**The source files contain sensitive data related to the database that is necessary for the backend system to function properly. However, I am taking steps to ensure that this data is secured before providing the full code.**
